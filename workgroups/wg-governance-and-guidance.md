# Workgroup: Governance and Guidance
ID: wg-governance-and-guidance<br>
Discord: #wg-governance-and-guidance

The Governance and Guidance workgroup handles SFOSC organization level tasks.
They are concerned aspects like the governance structure of SFOSC, making sure we're following our
own [Social contract](https://sfosc.org/about/social_contract) and
[principles](https://sfosc.org/docs/principles), set up and give appropriate permissions to the other
workgroups, enforcing the [Code of Conduct](https://sfosc.org/about/code_of_conduct), and so on.

**Join when** you are interested in how SFOSC organizes itself.
